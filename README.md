Hi, I'm Albert. A Web Engineer by profession. I write software for a living. At [Otesha] (https://otesha.co), a software development boutique, I'm helping clients on screening, staffing and product development. Previously worked in international development and consulting creating ICT4D solutions in Africa. I'm not a nerd/geek nor your typical ~~10x developer~~ but care about my craft and I'm just an all around good person with ambition to push the bard further.
